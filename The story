Anna Parket lives in the beautiful urban town of Dalhurst.

She lives a perfect life working as a doctor at General Hospital in the next town called Modesto. 

Anna has lived with her boyfriend Tony Meadow for several years. Tony is the overseeing manager for Dalhurst's water plant. 

They live a happy, healthy life with their dogs across from Lake Median in a big house 
sitting on a 2 acre property hidden within the woods. 

The house was inherited from Tony's grandparents a few years back. 

Everybody in town knew Tony's grandparents, and their death was very unexpected.

Many neighbors and close friends came over to say good bye to Tony's grandparents at their funeral.

Anna and Tony felt very welcomed by the people of Dalhurst at Tony's grandparents funeral.

The couple started to fall in love with the people of Dalhurst after their show of kindness. 

Both of them loved their morning walks with dogs around the lake and their tea time on weekends at "Luna" Caffee. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lately, Tony has been away on a business trip for over a week. 
When Anna gets off her of her friday night work shift at the hospital. She comes home to her dogs and an empty house. 

Anna makes herself a pepperoni pizza and decides to watch a movie called, "Shadow Noises".  

As she was watching the movie,she hears a noise coming from the basement. 

Anna is shocked by the noise. She knows that she locked all the doors and windows before Tony left for his trip. 

She calls Tony on his cellphone. 

The phone rings 3 times and she hears Tony's voice over his voicemail,stating that he is unable to take
the call and to leave a message. 

She presses the end button for the call on her cellphone. She starts to pace around the living room.

Anna tries calling back one more time hoping that Tony will pick up. Tony doesn't answer again. 
Anna suddenly remembers that a baseball bat was in the living room closet. 

She runs to the closet and grabs the metal baseball bat. She hears another banging noise coming from the basement.

Anna starts to get nervous as she walks toward the basement door.

Her stomach starts to tighten and turn. Sweat starts to form down her back. 

The sounds are making her feel even more afraid.

She gets to the basement door and she takes a shaking sigh. Anna knows that she is by herself. 

She ponders, "Maybe, we got rats from the neighbors or maybe a pipe burst?"  

However, Anna knows that those noises do not sound like either of those things. 

Anna turns the doorknob on the basement door and slowly enters the basement.

She turns on the light and heads down the basement stairs. 

Anna slowly walks down the basement stairs. The steps creak loudly as if her weight might cause the step to snap in half.  

She feels nervous because of the noises. She fears the unknows that is in the basement. 

She knows that no one will be looking for her until Monday after she has missed her required work shift. 

Before Anna reaches the final step in the basement, she hears a loud thud. She screams in fear, hoping that the neighbors will hear her! 

She thinks to herself, "This is it...this is how I am going to die!"

Anna starts to swing her bat around furiously with her eyes closed. 

She feels nothing but air. She swings her bat once more and slowly opens her eyes. 

Anna realizes that there is nothing in front of her. 

Sweat is pouring down her face and down her back. She breathes heavily trying to catch her breath. 

She looks around nervously and sees a racoon dashing out of the window while a rat runs behind boxes that are stacked in a corner.

"Ugh, I need to set more traps for these stupid rats" thinks Anna as she closes the basement window. 

Anna heads to the basement shelf that contains all of their household cleaning products. 

She looks for a rat trap on the shelf and notices that the box is empty. 

She knows that she bought more rat traps during the last time that she was at the store. 

She also remembers that she gave Tony the box to Tony, he was going to bring the box to the basement. 

Tony and Anna have been trying to get rid of the rats in their house since they moved in. 

Anna lets out a long sigh and starts to search differnt boxes throughout the basement for the rat traps. 

Anna opens a box and finds a silver sword. 

The sword was encrusted with different jewels that glistened against the silver polish of the sword. 

Anna carefully picks up the sword with both hands as it looks pretty old...  

She is sure that Tom will know what the sword is doing there because she doesn't remember having it.

When Tom finally calls her back she describes it and Tom doesn't have a clue about where it came from. They start to guess how did it get there.

Maybe the neighbors brought it for the funeral? Maybe it belongs to Tom's family or maybe someone or something brought it there...

Yes! This must be the racoon! It make sense the sound she heard was from this metal falling down!

However, how did the racoon get it? Why did it bring it here? Where did the raccoon come from? All these questions were spinning in her head that night.

Anna wasn't the only one not able to sleep. Tom also laid sleepless.

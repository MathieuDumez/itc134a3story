Anna Parket lives in a beautiful urban town of Dalhurst.

She has the perfect life working as a doctor at General Hospital in the next town called Modesto. 

Anna has lived with her boyfriend Tony Meadow for several years. Tony is the overseeing manager for Dalhurst's water plant. 

They live a happy, healthy life with their dogs across from Lake Median in a big house 
sitting on a 2 acre property hidden within the woods. 

The house was inherited from Tony's grandparents a few years back. 

Everybody in town knew Tony's grandparents, and their death was very unexpected.

Many neighbors and close friends came over to say good bye to Tony's grandparents at their funeral.

Anna and Tony felt very welcomed by the town at Tony's grandparents funeral.

The couple started to fall in love with the town after their show of kindness. People seemed to be very happy in Dalhurst. 

Smiley faces wherever you look, kids running in the park, moms with strollers chatting and giggling,
even joggers are smiling despite their running effort.

Both of them loved their morning walks with dogs around the lake and their tea time on weekends at "Luna" Caffee. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lately, Tony has been away on a business trip for over a week. 
When Anna gets off her of her friday night work shift at the hospital. She comes home to her dogs and an empty house. 

Anna makes herself a pepporini pizza and decides to watch a movie called, "Shadow Noises".  

As she was watching the movie - she hears a noise coming from the basement. 

Anna is shocked by the noise. She knows that she locked all the doors and windows before Tony left for his trip. 

She calls Tony on his cellphone. 

The phone rings 3 times and she hears Tony's voice over his voicemail- stating that he is unable to take
the call and to leave a message. 

She presses the end button for the call on her cellphone. She starts to pace around the living room.

Anna tries calling back one more time hoping that Tony will pick up. Tony doesn't answer again. 
Anna suddenly remembers that a baseball bat was in the living room closet. 

She runs to the closet and grabs the metal baseball bat. She hears another banging noise coming from the basement.

Anna starts to get nervous as she walks toward the basement door.

Her stomach starts to tighten and turn. Sweat starts to form down her back. 

The sounds are making her feel even more afraid.

She gets to the basement door and she takes a shaking sigh. Anna knows that she is by herself. 

She ponders, "Maybe, we got rats from the neighbors or maybe a pipe burst?"  

However, Anna knows that those noises do not sound like either of those things. 

Anna turns the doorknob on the basement door and slowly enters the basement.

She turns on the light and heads down the basement stairs. 

Anna slowly walks down the basement stairs. The steps creak loudly as if her weight might cause the step to snap in half.  

She feels nervous due to the noises and scared because she might get hurt in this basement with these rinky stairs. 

She knows that no one will be looking for her until Monday after she has missed her required work shift. 

Before Anna reaches the final step in the basement, she hears a loud thud. She screams in fear, hoping that the neighbors will hear her! 

She thinks to herself, "This is it...this is how I am going to die!"

Anna starts to swing her bat around furiously with her eyes closed. 

She feels nothing but air. She swings her bat once more and slowly opens her eyes. 

Anna realizes that there is nothing in front of her. 

Sweat beads are pouring down her face and down her back. She breathes heavily trying to catch her breath. 

She looks around nervously and sees a racoon dashing out of the window while a rat runs behind boxes that are stacked in a corner.

"Ugh, I need to step more traps for these stupid rats" thinks Anna as she closes the basement window. 

Anna heads to the basement shelf that contains all of their household cleaning products. 

She looks for a rat traps on the shelf and notices that the box was empty. 

She knows that she bought more rat traps during the last time that she was at the hardware store. 

She also remembers that she gave Tony the box of rat traps to bring downstairs. 

Tony and Anna have been trying to get rid of the rats in their house since they moved in. 

Anna lets out a long sigh and starts to search differnt boxes throughout the basement for the rat traps. 

Anna opens a box that contains a silver sword. 

The sword was encrusted with different jewels that glistened against the silver polish of the sword. 

Anna carefully picks up the sword with both hands as it is too heavy to hold with just one. 

Anna has never seen this sword before and her mind races wondering where could this beautiful sword come from.

Anna Parker has the perfect life working as a doctor in the city, living together with her boyfriend Tony Meadow.

They live a happy, healthy and wealthy life in a big house together with their dogs.

This all changes when she finds a weird glowing blade in her basement. 

Anna is shocked by her discovery and asks Tom if he knows what it is and why it was in their basement.

He also seemed to be very surprised but easily gets back to his hobby and forgets about it.

Anna couldn't sleep that night...
